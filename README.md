# PcPartsScraper
Python code which scrapes the prices of computer parts based on given configuration. In config files you specify the css selectors for specific things that you scrape like product name, code, price. You also specify shops which u want to scrape and search phrases like GTX 3080. When satisified with the configuration you can run the python script and let it run, it will save results to the database. In this repo there is also .NET API for serving the scrapped data but I discontinued the project because I actually managed to get the desired PC parts with the help of this software.
